Return Negative

n this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?
<br>
Examples
makeNegative(1);    // return -1
makeNegative(-5);   // return -5
makeNegative(0);    // return 0
makeNegative(0.12); // return -0.12
<br>
Notes
<br>
The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
<br>
Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.
